# test: issue_188
# this is a test for issue 188 where subtasks is is running in a different directory
# than the main task
# the main issue is that while running in interactive shell, and an subtask runs infinitely in a different directory
# the whole application is also sticking to this path, and fails to run any other task, because the current taksfile 
# is not found in the subtask directory
# this test is to check if this behavior is also present in the regular run without interactive shell
