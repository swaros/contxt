you could define the order of task execution, and if the run simultaneously or not, just by the order of the target parmeters as described here [here](https://github.com/swaros/contxt/blob/wip/shared/docs/documentation/taskdetailed.md#simultaneously-execution)

but you can also define this behavior in the task file.
